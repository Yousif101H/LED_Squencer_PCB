# LED_Squencer_PCB
This is a simple two layer LED_squencer using 555 timer as a Astable Multivibrator (datasheet: https://shorturl.at/efP25 ) to generate the frequency for CD4017BM High speed 16 pin CMOS Decade counter (datasheet: https://components101.com/sites/default/files/component_datasheet/cd4017%20datasheet.pdf ).
I use a 100k Pot in series with the RB so I can change the speed of LED squenc.
